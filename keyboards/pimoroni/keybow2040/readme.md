# Keybow 2040

The [Pimoroni Keybow 2040][keybow2040] is a 16 key mechanical macropad
controlled by a Raspberry Pi RP2040, with Kailh hot swap sockets and
per key RGB lighting, in a decorative FR4 sandwich. The Keybow 2040 is
also known by its codename Venus Dust, or its product codes of the
form PIM56x.

## bootloader

The procedure to flash the firmware is similar to other RP2040
devices. You can enter the bootloader in two ways:

  * **Vulcan nerve pinch**: hold down BOOTSEL while pressing RESET
    (not so great if you have configured BOOTSEL to do something)

  * **MrÂ Resetti double-tap**: press RESET twice quickly
    (only works when running the QMK firmware)

on the Keybow 2040](https://learn.pimoroni.com/article/circuitpython-and-keybow-2040)


## notes

  * The BOOTSEL button doubles as a 17th configurable key. The
    RP2040's ROM firmware implements the BOOTSEL feature, so there's
    no need for QMK's bootmagic feature.

  * The default keymap has F13 - F20 on the top half of the board
    (nearest the USB socket), and a navigation cluster (arrows, home,
    end, page up/down) on the bottom half. The BOOTSEL button changes
    the RGB matrix mode.

  * The Keybow 2040 CircuitPython firmware uses VID = 0x16D0, PID = 0x08C6,
    but this QMK firmware has different USB IDs to avoid confusing drivers:
    VID = 0x5069 ('Pi'), PID = 0x4784 (4 'x' 4)
